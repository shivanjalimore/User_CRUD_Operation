I have developed a comprehensive User Management System incorporating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. </br> This system allows for seamless user interaction, enabling the addition of new users, modification of specific user details, </br>deletion of users, and retrieval of a complete list of users along with their associated information stored within the database.

 -> For the backend code, proceed to src/main/java/com. </br>
 -> For the frontend code, head over to  src/main/webapp.
