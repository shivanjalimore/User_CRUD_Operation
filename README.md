I have developed a comprehensive User Management System incorporating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This system allows for seamless user interaction, enabling the addition of new users, modification of specific user details, deletion of users, and retrieval of a complete list of users along with their associated information stored within the database.


 -  To access the codebase, navigate to the following directories:
 -> For the backend code, proceed to src/main/java/com.
 -> For the frontend code, head over to  src/main/webapp.
